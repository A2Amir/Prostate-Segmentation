Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) produces detailed anatomical images of the prostate and its areas. It plays a crucial role in many diagnostic applications. Automatic segmentation of prostate and prostate zones from MR images makes many diagnostic and therapeutic applications easier. In this repository, I tried to segment prostate using Pix2Pix network.
